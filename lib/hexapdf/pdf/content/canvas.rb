      # This class provides the basic drawing operations supported by PDF.
      #
      # == General Information
      #
      # A canvas object is used for modifying content streams on a level higher than text. It would
      # be possible to write a content stream by hand since PDF uses a simplified reversed polish
      # notation for specifying operators: First come the operands, then comes the operator and no
      # operator returns any result. However, it is easy to make mistakes this way and one has to
      # know all operators and their operands.
      #
      # This is rather tedious and therefore this class exists. It allows one to modify a content
      # stream by invoking methods that should be familiar to anyone that has ever used a graphic
      # API. There are methods for moving the current point, drawing lines and curves, setting the
      # color, line width and so on.
      #
      # == PDF Graphics
      #
      # === Graphics Operators and Objects
      #
      # There are about 60 PDF content stream operators. Some are used for changing the graphics
      # state, some for drawing paths and others for showing text. This is all abstracted through
      # the Canvas class.
      #
      # PDF knows about five different graphics objects: path objects, text objects, external
      # objects, inline image objects and shading objects. If none of the five graphics objects is
      # current, the content stream is at the so called page description level (in between graphics
      # objects).
      #
      # Additionally the PDF operators are divided into several groups, like path painting or text
      # showing operators, and such groups of operators are allowed to be used only in certain
      # graphics objects or the page description level.
      #
      # Have a look at the PDF specification (PDF1.7 s8.2) for more details.
      #
      # HexaPDF tries to ensure the proper use of the operators and graphics objects and if it
      # cannot do it, an error is raised. So if you don't modify a content stream directly but via
      # the Canvas methods, you generally don't have to worry about the low-level inner workings.
      #
      # === Graphics State
      #
      # Some operators modify the so called graphics state (see GraphicsState). The graphics state
      # is a collection of settings that is used during processing or creating a content stream. For
      # example, the path painting operators don't have operands to specify the line width or the
      # stroke color but take this information from the graphics state.
      #
      # One important thing about the graphics state is that it is only possible to restore a prior
      # state using the save and restore methods. It is not possible to reset the graphics state
      # while creating the content stream!
      #
      # === Paths
      #
      # A PDF path object consists of one or more subpaths. Each subpath can be a rectangle or can
      # consist of lines and cubic bÃ©zier curves. No other types of subpaths are known to PDF.
      # However, the Canvas class contains additional methods that use the basic path construction
      # methods for drawing other standard paths like circles.
      #
      # When a subpath is started, the current graphics object is changed to path object. After all
      # path constructions are finished, a path painting methods needs to be invoked to change back
      # to the page description level. Optionally, the path painting method may be preceeded by a
      # clipping path method to change the current clipping path (see TODO).
      #
      # There are three kinds of path painting methods: Those that stroke the path, those that fill
      # the path and those that stroke and fill the path. In addition filling may be done using
      # either the nonzero winding number rule or the even-odd rule.
      #
      #
      # = Special Graphics State Methods
      #
      # These methods are only allowed when the current graphics object is the page description
      # level.
